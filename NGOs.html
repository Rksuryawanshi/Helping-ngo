        <h2>KARMA FOUNDATION</h2>
        <p>
          We, at Karma Foundation truly believe that animals are the real
          victims on earth. They didn't declare war, they don't have weapons and
          they don't want to destroy humans or impose their religion. Their only
          "crime" is that they exist. Keeping the ever rising cases of
          accidents, cruelty, starvation, illnesses and so on, we have built an
          Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Operation Theatre (OT) & Out Patient
          Department (OPD) for such animals who suffer each day on the streets
          of the city
